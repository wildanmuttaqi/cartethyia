/**

 * `risunCodex/Cartethyia` is the primary repository and the destination of
 * every public surface — header links, the GitHub badge, and the star/fork
 * counts. The original `risunCode/Cartethyia` was hidden from public view by
 * GitHub after automated star activity was flagged as manipulation; it is kept
 * here as `GITHUB_ALT_REPO` so operators who still have access keep a path to
 * the historical repository, and so a rename cannot drop that link entirely.
 * It is offered as a secondary menu entry, never as the visible default.
 *
 * These were declared twice: one copy in the console shell built them from a
 * repo slug, and the share page's badge component carried its own hardcoded URL
 * plus a second copy of the slug for the shields.io badges. Two literals for
 * one repository means a rename moves one surface and leaves the other pointing
 * at the old project, so every link and every badge resolves from here.
