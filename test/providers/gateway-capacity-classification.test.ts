/**
 * A gateway concurrency rejection must never be read as an account rate limit.
 *
 * `provider_capacity_exhausted` is raised by this gateway's own routing when
 * every account serving a model is already at its max-inflight. Nothing is
 * wrong with the credential — the ceiling is. But the error is a 429 whose
 * text says "rate limit", so it matched the `rate-limit` arm and cooled the
 * account for the full 15-minute rate-limit window. Every account then read
 * `cooldown`, so all of them looked busy while requests piled up.
 *
 * These pin the rejection as capacity-with-no-account-penalty, and pin the
 * rate-limit arm still working for rejections an upstream actually sent.
