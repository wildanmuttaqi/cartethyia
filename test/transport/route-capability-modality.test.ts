/**
 * A declared input modality must win over the codec's rich-content grant.
 *
 * `buildCapabilityProfile` used to compute `image: inputMods.includes("image") || codecEncodesRichContent`,
 * which made the grant an *override*: every row on a canonical-codec provider
 * claimed image support even when the catalog declared `["text"]`. Qoder is
 * that case — it has no bespoke wire, so the grant fired, and an image was
 * forwarded to an upstream that rejects it. The catalog's own `is_vl: false`
 * never mattered.
 *
 * `defineModel` always seeds `"text"`, so a non-empty array is an explicit
 * declaration and its contents are authoritative; an empty array is a row that
 * carried no modality metadata, which is the pass-through case the grant
 * exists to protect. Both directions are pinned here.
